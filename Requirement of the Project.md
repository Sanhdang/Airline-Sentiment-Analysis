## Requirement of the Project

The purpose of this project is to perform an in-depth analysis of airline passenger reviews to evaluate customer satisfaction, identify key factors influencing sentiment, and provide actionable recommendations for service improvement. The project requirements are as follows:

1. **Data Acquisition**
   - Obtain a dataset of passenger reviews including airline name, cabin type, overall score, review text, service ratings, and travel details.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and ensure data consistency.
   - Standardize date formats and categorical variables.
   - Preprocess review text for analysis, including tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization.

3. **Sentiment Analysis**
   - Apply a suitable sentiment analysis tool (e.g., VADER) to classify and score passenger reviews.
   - Calculate average positive sentiment scores for each airline overall and by cabin class.

4. **Trend and Comparative Analysis**
   - Compare overall ratings of Qantas Airways against the top 5 airlines over time.
   - Identify the airline with the highest positive sentiment overall, in Economy Class, and in Business Class.

5. **Topic Modeling**
   - Implement Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to discover common themes in passenger reviews.
   - Compare topics between the top 3 and bottom 3 airlines.

6. **Visualization**
   - Create graphs and charts to display sentiment trends, rating comparisons, and topic distributions.
   - Generate word clouds to visualize prominent terms in each topic.

7. **Insights and Recommendations**
   - Summarize findings from sentiment analysis and topic modeling.
   - Provide practical, data-driven recommendations to improve customer satisfaction and service quality.

8. **Documentation and Reporting**
   - Prepare a clear and structured report including methodology, results, insights, and recommendations.
   - Ensure proper referencing of all external sources used in the analysis.
